HOW TO RUN:

Run `make re` and am executable called fractal will be create. Runs only on OS X and Linux.

Then do `./fractal {1-5}` to run the specfic fractal.
For example `./fractal 1` will run Mandelbrot, 2 is Julia, 3 is Tree, 4 is Rosae and 5 is Bloup (I gave random names)

If you want to save an image you need to press `enter` and it will ask you to put a name, just hit `enter` again.

You can zoom with + and - or by scrolling up or down.

Youc can move around with the arrows and you can play with the shape of Julia with the space bar.
